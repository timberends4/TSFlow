## Installation

If you want to run our code, start by setting up the python environment.
We use [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) to easily set up reproducible environments based on conda packages.
Install it with `curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash` and then run

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/marcelkollovieh/TSFlow.git

# Change into the repository
cd TSFlow

# Install and activate the environment
pixi shell
```

## Training

Start a training by running `train.py` with the your settings, for example
```sh
python bin/train_model.py -c configs_local/train_conditional.yaml
```

The results will be logged in `./logs`
